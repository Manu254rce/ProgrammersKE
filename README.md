# ProgrammersKE
Kenyan Geeks with a knack for programming and stuff


Programmers Ke is a web app idea that involves a service similar to computer tutorial websites like Javatpoint and Programiz. So we’re aiming to create something like that, especially since it’s important for countries like Kenya to embrace technology as part of life. We want to offer basic coding and programming tutorials to most young people here who are into computer science, but have no idea of what it really is all about. Moreover, it’s to help them understand the existence of programming languages, how apps are developed and why things in the technology world seem as they are.  

Now, that seems enough for a web application that guide you into computer science, but we thought about taking things a notch higher. In reality, most people who end up finishing undergraduate level in computer science have the theoretical aspect of things, but while many also have the practical aspect and are able to export ideas to the rest of the world, unfortunately in Kenya, the complaints of lacking connections out there after finishing school are still existent. Despite great university education. Again, Kenya is just like the rest of the world and if the intentions are to keep it at it’s competitive advantage in tech solutions, the people themselves need to have a way in keeping themselves up to date with the trends, so as to offer a sustainable innovation and we’ll informed decisions in the software development flow. 

So in Programmers KE we conceptualized something more than just tutorials on how to print an area of a circle. Rather, we opted to give programming newcomers some level of exposure into the world of technology while at the same time, learning more than what they do at their ACS degree. Since our web application will be on it’s way towards a Web3 type  of architecture, then we’re striving to keep it as free and decentralized as possible. Therefore creating a kind of interactive environment amongst Kenyans and many more outside Kenya alike, to share technology ideas amongst each other and get mobilized into developing software as well as project management cycles. At the same time, these people get a chance for exposure and a higher sense of contribution into innovation and technology. Especially when it’s about offering them with the know-how to find the software tools good for your workflows. If anything just grasp that we strive to bring Kenyan computer science enthusiasts together and we bring innovators into a place where they’re able to stand as being able to conceptualize diversified ideas and those which are as revolutionary… 

The Tech Stack( experimental, will still undergo development and future changes) 

Frontend: 

-HTML

-React.JS for the UI

-Tailwind-CSS for styling 

-PostCSS to purge out any unused CSS scripts 

API and Middlemen: 

-Django will mostly do the job here 

Backend and web service: 

-Django for the utilities. The project will be based on a .NET architecture to integrate easily with Azure and Microsoft SQL. 

-Azure for web hosting service 

Web bundling and deployment: 

-Vite.js/ Webpack. Here, I use Vite React and React -javascript as the variant.
